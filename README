nano hot key daemon (nhkd) is a very simple hotkey daemon for X11 with
limited functionality.

It is partially based on code from dwm:

    http://dwm.suckless.org/

If you're looking for a more powerful alternative, have a look at sxhkd:

Installation
------------

The following C libraries are required:

    - libx11

nhkd expects to be run on a POSIX-ish operating system.

You must customize the program by creating your own config.h based on
config.h.example. In any case, config.h must exist in order to build the
program.

To build the program and install it to /usr/local:

    $ make
    # make install


Running
-------

Run it from your ~/.xinitrc:

    while sleep 0.25; do nhkd; done &

The loop ensures that you can easily restart the daemon by killing it.
